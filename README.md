# PracticeAssignment01
1) I added the code for each function: recursive and iterative factorial and recursive and iterative fibonacci.
2) I had to comment out the package description at the top of the interfaces (package edu.usfca.cs.cs245;) since it did not benefit the program
3) Everything works as it should. The functions passed the correctness tests.
